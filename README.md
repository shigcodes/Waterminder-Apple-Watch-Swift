# Waterminder-Apple-Watch---Swift
WaterMinder aims to help individuals keep track of their daily water intake and stay hydrated. It is typically implemented as an apple watch application that allows users to set a daily water intake goal, record their water consumption throughout the day, and receive reminders to drink water if they fall behind on their goal.
